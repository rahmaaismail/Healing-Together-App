# Healing Together Project: Western Engineering Competition 2025  

📅 **January 2025** | 🏆 **3rd Place – Innovative Design**  

## Overview  
**Healing Together** is a **high-fidelity Figma prototype** of a caregiver-focused **app and website** designed to enhance **support, collaboration, and well-being** for caregivers.  

I personally designed the Figma prototype, prioritizing **intuitive navigation, accessibility, and user-centric features**. My partner developed a **functional website** hosted locally to complement the app prototype.  

The project was showcased at the **2025 Western Engineering Competition (WEC)** at the University of Saskatchewan, where we presented to three judges using a **trifold display, the Figma prototype, and the functional website**.  
Our work earned **3rd place in the Innovative Design category**, recognizing our impactful solution with a **plaque and medal**.

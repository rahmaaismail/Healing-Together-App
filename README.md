Healing Together Project: Western Engineering Competition 2025
📅 January 2025 | 🏆 3rd Place – Innovative Design

Overview
Healing Together is a high-fidelity Figma prototype of a caregiver-focused app and website designed to enhance support, collaboration, and well-being for caregivers.

I personally designed the Figma prototype, prioritizing intuitive navigation, accessibility, and user-centric features. My partner developed a functional website hosted locally to complement the app prototype.

The project was showcased at the 2025 Western Engineering Competition (WEC) at the University of Saskatchewan, where we presented to three judges using a trifold display, the Figma prototype, and the functional website. Our work earned 3rd place in the Innovative Design category, recognizing our impactful solution with a plaque and medal.
